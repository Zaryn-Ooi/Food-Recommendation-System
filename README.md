## Project Overview: 
In this project, we used user review to built a food recommendation system to help users decide which restaurant to visit.

## Dataset Description
### Data Source -
The data was collected from [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/)

Yelp is a business directory service and crowd-sourced review forum that develops, hosts and markets the Yelp.com website and the Yelp mobile app, which publish crowd-sourced reviews about businesses. Yelp attempted to solve the problem “What should I eat?”  This can best be represented as “I’m in [town]. Where can I go to get the [best/fastest/cheapest/easiest] [food/service/etc]?” Your friend’s recommendations are likely the largest influencer of where you will go if you have no preference. Yelp provided a service for when that was either not available or not trusted.

### Data Content -
1st dataset: User review data
2nd dataset: Restaurant description (Eg.name, address, location, ratings)
